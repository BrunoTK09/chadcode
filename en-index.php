                <center><h2>MOST USED LANGUAGES ON THE MARKET</h2></center>
                <br>
                    <p class="lead">When we thought about or ask about the IT (Information of Technology) market, it has shown that there’s a shortage of professionals to meet the demand for work in the area or a lack of qualifications. We understand that, there are plenty of vacancies and a lack of qualified people. 
                        Programming is also included in areas where there’s a need for workers. The programmer is a highly demanded professional by the market, however it is necessary to be qualified to attract attention and companies.
<BR>
<BR>
Thinking positively is, making your qualification done individually with technical courses, EAD, in which the investment is small and the result is huge.
ChadCode along with CodeGuide is a community that provides contact with professionals, students and teachers, for a better understanding of the subject. Therefore, in partnership with CodeGuide, we have the EAD study, with quality courses in the most diverse languages, interacting with the CC (Chadcode) community.
<BR>
<BR>
The assistance given in the study process for students is one of the best, according to the students themselves, as it understands the personal and professional side of each one. We concluded that CC offers a wider and more tangible world without having great frustrations when seeing so many new and different things, for example, the codes.
In the future, it’s clear that programming will be one of the most important and valued areas, next to mathematics, as the job market will always need updates in information technology and its languages.

                        <center><h2>Skills that people can acquire or add by studying I.T.</h2></center><BR>
                        <p class="lead">Know the skills of an IT professional is necessary because is constantly changing and that’s a great differential nowadays. To work in this sector, it takes a lot of insight, creativity and the ability to relate. In addition, knowing the English language has become a fundamental and practically mandatory.
                         In this article, we will expose some of the skills that can be acquired by studying and venturing into the great Information Technology codes.<BR><BR>
                
                      <center> <h2>Demand for IT professionals</h2><BR></center>
                      <p class="lead">Information Technology professionals are increasingly demanded by the market. And it's no wonder, as technological development reaches very advanced levels over time, as people depend more on this work to carry out their activities. Even the pandemic crisis helped to accelerate this movement. After all, everything gets more technological.<BR><BR>

                      As a result, companies need teams that are able to modernize their work methods and internal processes. The digital presence is also a driver in this sense, since applications in this area of knowledge necessarily pass through IT professionals. The improvement of resources in daily work activities becomes necessary.<BR><BR>

                      Areas such as computer programming have a very large shortage of professionals. It is estimated that by 2025, 800,000 new jobs will be opened in this sector, but the training of new professionals does not keep up with this pace. Therefore, we need to stretch more and bring more "security" to new students and professionals, in the area. Knowing that at first contact, it scares.<BR><BR>

                      However, anyone who wants to be part of this select workforce should know that the IT professional's skills go beyond the technical area. One of them encompasses the personal skills, so talked about nowadays and put in the form of emotional intelligence. It is not enough just to know the technical side of the process, it is also necessary to live well with the people around you and often put aside stubbornness and listen to others.<BR><BR><BR>

                   <center><h2>Skills of an IT Professional</h2><BR></center>
                   <p class="lead">As we speak, your IT professional skillset and skill set goes well beyond your technical capability. The horizons of work have expanded in this area, making a much more complete training required.<BR><BR>


                       <center><h2>Logical reasoning</h2><BR></center>
                       <p class="lead">Whenever we need to solve a problem in a sequential way or create an argument, we use this skill. In addition, this reasoning avoids a lower error rate and that is why there's the importance of developing it as soon as possible.<BR><BR>

                       In everyday life, these skills and logical reasoning skills are important to identify misleading advertising, biased or false news, and malicious speech. In the professional world, this skill is important to identify market tricks, think of strategies to attract customers and improve your power of argument and persuasion.<BR><BR>

                       Logical thinking is a skill that allows individuals to make valid, compelling, and important arguments to earn the trust of customers, teams, bosses, and co-workers.<BR><BR>
                           
                       With this characteristic, it is possible to develop the ability to create and interpret different situations in everyday life, influencing positive results. Technological advances are getting faster and more frequent and people are already being replaced by artificial intelligence, so it is important to train this skill of the future.<BR><BR>
                           
                       To know the logic of programming and acquire knowledge, it is necessary to have discipline and commitment in studies. The ability to learn the concepts that make up the reasoning for programming, such as knowing algorithms, variables, arithmetic operations and vectors, for example, is essential. <BR><BR>
                           
                       We have some books that can help you in this exercise and in this development, such as Casa do Código - Lógica de programação, among others. <BR><BR>
                           
                  <center>  <h2>Second Language</h2><BR></center>
                  <p class="lead">When we speak of a second language for those who work in the IT field, we refer to English. Due to the increase in competition and the emergence of new applications, understanding the English language has become almost mandatory. However, even today there are professionals who do not seek to improve in this area. Noting that most, if not all, codes are made in English.<BR><BR>

                  In addition, there’s a strong appeal to work abroad, a phenomenon we call the brain drain. It is not uncommon for the best opportunities to be found in foreign countries. And to take advantage of them, it is necessary to learn at least English. This means that, quickly, the need has shifted to the domain of the third language, and not more of the second. Therefore, we are constantly changing and studying.<BR><BR>
                
                        <center> <h2>Adaptation</h2></center><BR>
                        <p class="lead">Most likely, few people disagree that the technology area is the one that undergoes through changes very quickly. Thus, the good IT professional must be able to adapt to changes and adapt in an agile way. Otherwise, you run the risk of becoming obsolete in a short time. We should not be stagnant in just one language or method, we CAN master one very well, and expand to others.<BR><BR>

                        An example that illustrates this well is in relation to social networks and all the businesses that orbit around them. Just 10 years ago, all this didn’t exist, but today it’s present in most people's daily lives. Business has shaped itself to this reality and the demand for professionals in this area has taken a huge leap.<BR><BR>

                        Likewise, there are significant updates going on right now in the IT world. Concepts such as Big Data, Machine Learning and Business Intelligence are developing at full speed. IT professionals need to learn and practice new skills all the time.<BR><BR>

                        <center>  <h2>Communication</h2></center><BR>
                        <p class="lead">This is a skill that’s often underestimated by those who work in the area, but the truth is that whoever can communicate more easily comes out ahead. The problem happens when an IT professional needs to speak with a member of another area of the company. At this point, the dialogue can get confusing.<BR><BR>

                        It's no use for a programmer to talk to the marketing team as if he were talking to a colleague in the sector, because the programming language isn’t clear to everyone. Therefore, those who can “translate” what happens into terms that the layperson can understand, has a very big advantage in the job market. Communicating well favors good work within an organization. In short, if you clarify, expressing yourself is part of a beautiful teamwork and a great result in the project.<BR><BR>

                        <center>  <h2>Creativity</h2></center><BR>
                        <p class="lead">IT professionals are often thought of as great problem solvers, and they really are. Thus, a skill that should be part of your portfolio is creativity. It’s needed to develop new solutions, often to old problems that are already familiar to most people.<BR><BR>

                        Anyone who thinks they are not gifted with enough creativity to work in the IT area should know that this is not true. It turns out that this ability can be developed, especially when we keep in touch with people from other areas of human knowledge who think differently from us. Just be open-minded and exercise tolerance. Always welcome to have these daydreams of creativity in solutions and creations, however strange the idea may seem. Combining communication with creativity, Brainstorm, when necessary and expand the possibilities of innovating.<BR><BR>

                        <center>  <h2>Teamwork</h2></center><BR>
                        <p class="lead">The time when the IT professional was seen as an isolated person is long gone. Increasingly, teams are made up of many people, so it’s necessary to know how to work well with all of them. In addition, problems are getting bigger and more complex, making working together a must. There is no mind that alone can solve such problems.<BR><BR>

                        The skills of a high-performance IT professional go through several areas of human knowledge. They range from relationships in the work environment to adaptability to new situations and scenarios. All this without leaving out foreignness, as the world is always connected, and the solutions are global. To be part of all this, it’s important to qualify with the support of good educational institutions.<BR><BR>
                      
                      <center>  <h2>Conclusion</h2></center><BR>
                      <p class="lead">In view of all these qualities that we will acquire, in addition to others during study and work, it is important to remember that these mentioned topics will help you to mature as a developer. We have many professionals or students who are having a hard time understanding some of these, like teamwork or even adaptation. What is new really scares, but it doesn't mean we are NOT capable, we just need time and persistence. And if we have help, like us at <b>ChadCode(CC)</b> and the people at <b>CodeGuide(CG)</b>, everything becomes easier and lighter to get there.
                       If you have any questions or want to chat, please contact us, see you soon <b>Chad's!</b>
